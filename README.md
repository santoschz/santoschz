# Hi, I'm Santo 👋

> **"I believe programming is the art of making things better. My goal is to transform complex technical challenges into seamless user experiences."**

I’ve been a tech geek since I can remember. For me, software is a tool for **social impact** and a lifelong curiosity about how the world works. I build at my own pace, prioritizing **quality, thoughtful design**, and the joy of creating things that actually help people.
